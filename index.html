            <h2>What is this page about?</h2>
            <p>
                Have you wondered how usable applications are designed? 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this webpage, we will explore the method of <b>iterative design</b>, a continuous and collaborative 
                process of identifying user problems, prototyping, gathering feedback, and refining the design to 
                meet real user needs. We will be using a real-world startup (Sesame), as a case study ðŸ™‚

            <h2>Step 1. Understanding the Problem Statement</h2>
            <p><a href="https://sesamecare.com/">Sesame</a> is a patient-centered healthcare 
                startup focused on connecting patients to affordable care. A key part of its 
                digital platform is a web-based medical content (blogs and videos) hub where patients can access 
                high-quality health information. The target users are <b>cost-conscious 
                patients</b> seeking credible provider options and <b>providers</b> looking to attract visits through the platform. 
                Currently, Sesame aims to address three main design issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For patients: increase the readability and accessibility of medical content</li>
                <li>For providers: improve the content creation experience through AI assistance and account growth tracking</li>
                <li>For both: create effective channels that convert patients into provider visits</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ultimate goal is to deliver clear and trustworthy health information that guides patients 
                to care options, while boosting provider engagement and visibility. It is hence important 
                that our design satisfies the needs of both groups.
            </p>

        <div class="section-2">
            <h2>Step 2. Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
            <p>Now that we understand the problems, we can brainstorm ideas and 
                create sketches. Below are four sets of sketches covering four key pages 
                we believe are essential to solving these issues in the content hub: a blog article page, a provider dashboard, and AI-assisted blog and video 
                creation pages. The sketches include a range of designs, such as different 
                AI interaction modes and CTAs (call-to-action elements) on the blog and dashboard pages.
            </p>
            <h3>Set 1</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_1.png" alt="Sketch Set 1">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 2</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_2.png" alt="Sketch Set 2">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 3</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_3.png" alt="Sketch Set 3">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 4</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_4.png" alt="Sketch Set 4">
            </div>
            <p>
                Next, we can combine these sketches to create <b>wireframes</b> using the Balsamiq software. We created 
                a initial set of 4 wireframes. Under each one, you can read explanations about how it addresses a problem 
                stated previously and impacts user experience.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Page 1: Blog Homepage</h3>
            
            <div class="lofi-prototype">
                <img src="lofi1_blog_home.png" alt="lofi1_blog_home">
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Although our original sketches didn't include a blog homepage, during team discussions we realized that adding one would help users discover topic-based content and browse articles based on popularity. This enhancement supports increased user engagement and boosts <b>conversion rates</b>.</li>
                <li>Our design moves away from the original text-heavy blog and creates a <b>modular, user-focused experience</b>.
                </li>
                <li>At the top, the hero section now features a welcome message alongside a search bar, helping users quickly find relevant health content. This upgrade improves information accessibility and shifts the experience from passive reading to active exploration and interaction.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Page 2: Individual Article Page</h3>
            <div class="lofi-prototype">
                <img src="lofi2_blog_subpage.png" alt="lofi2_blog_subpage">
            </div>
            <ul class="explanation">
                <li>
                    We used the design from Set 1 as the baseline, as its layout is the most intuitive and offers a strong <b>information hierarchy</b>.

                </li>
                <li>We also incorporated a floating section featuring the provider from Set 2. Users can click into the provider's profile, book an appointment, or ask questions directly. By improving the provider's <b>visibility</b>, we aim to increase conversion rates and help build the provider's personal brand, which is aligned with Sesame's goal.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition, we added the video section from Set 4 to address the issue of long text and improve article <b>readability</b>â€”especially for users who prefer video content. While this feature may require more effort from providers, our built-in AI tool can streamline the process by converting articles into video scripts. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Page 3: Provider Dashboard</h3>
            <div class="lofi-prototype">
                <img src="lofi3_provider_dashboard.png" alt="lofi3_provider_dashboard">
            </div>
            <ul class="explanation">
                <li>
                    We combined the designs from Sets 1, 3, and 4. Specifically, we used Set 4 as the baseline and integrated key features from Sets 1 and 3.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The most important feature is the Quick Stats section, which provides providers with an <b>immediate overview</b> of their content's performanceâ€”separated by articles and videos. By displaying metrics such as total reads, conversion rates, and likes, we reinforce the tangible value of their contributions. This aligns with Sesame's goal of encouraging providers to consistently generate content by making performance data easily accessible and actionable.

                </li>
                <li>At the top right, the "Create Content" call-to-action is designed to encourage <b>immediate content creation</b>. Clicking this button leads to an AI-powered editor, reducing the time needed to publish high-quality content. This feature supports Sesame's mission to empower providers to produce scalable and authentic content efficiently.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Page 4: AI Assistant Page</h3>
            <div class="lofi-prototype">
                <img src="lofi4_ai_assistant.png" alt="lofi4_ai_assistant">
            </div>
            <ul class="explanation">
                <li>
                   We debated between two approaches. The first was a <b>step-by-step, modularized AI assistant</b>. 
                   This approach makes it easy for providers to draft an article, as the steps are built-in and 
                   clearly defined. However, it also greatly limits what a provider can do. 
                   The second approach was a <b>chat-based AI assistant</b>. This offers providers 
                   more freedom but is more open-ended, and users might not engage with it as we intend. 

                </li>
                <li>
                    After analyzing the trade-offs, we decided to go with the chat-based AI assistant, 
                    considering users' conceptual models regarding AI assistantsâ€”they may already be 
                    familiar with this format through prior experience with tools like ChatGPT and Claude.</li>
                <li>
                    We also created an <b>interactive canvas</b> for user editing
                    (inspired by set 2), where users can highlight sentences they want to 
                    refine and prompt the AI to revise them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After some discussion, we decided not to include a blog generation 
                    feature in order to preserve providers' <b>autonomy</b> in content creation and 
                    to prevent potential misinformation or errors in AI-generated content.
                </li>
            </ul>
