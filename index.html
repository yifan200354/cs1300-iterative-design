                Have you ever encountered websites that are poorly designed and wondered how we could improve them?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this webpage, we will explore how to redesign a website to improve its usability and accessibility, from identifying issues to creating 
                Figma prototypes and actually implementing the redesign. We will use the website of Ceremony Cafe, a famous 
                cafe in Providence, Rhode Island, as example üôÇ

            <h2>What are issues with the Ceremony Cafe website?</h2>
            <p>Ceremony Cafe in Providence is one of the most famous cafes in the region, 
                so it's interesting to examine whether its online presence is as 
                established as its physical store. Although the website contains all 
                the relevant information, some of it is not organized in a user-friendly manner. 
                The <a href="https://www.ceremonypvd.com/menus">menu page</a> (see scrollable image below) consists of a series of static and hard-to-read images.

                Here are some issues with this page: 
                </ul>
                <div class="dropdown-menu">
                    <details>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    as revealed by <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>, an automated tool for assessing website accessibility,
                                    the alt texts for the menu images are ineffective since they do not capture details about specific drinks
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    for example, the alt text for the bar menu is simply ‚Äúcocktails,‚Äù which is unhelpful to users
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    the small default size of the menu images further lowers accessibility
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    there lacks a high-level explanation of the different menus and their display order, which makes it difficult for first-time users to 
                                    learn the webpage structure
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    the lack of clear differentiation between different 
                                    types of information (e.g., menu subsection titles, item descriptions) 
                                    further adds to the confusion
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Memorability</summary>

                                <li>
                                the menus do not look visually differentiable enough and do not follow a clear color code, so it's easy for users to 
                                forget what menus there are when and where they are located, when they revisit the website
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    the page does not effectively support users in
                                    finding specific drinks or learning more about them
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    this is because the menus are vertically layered on top of each other, and it takes a long time for users to 
                                    scroll through the page and find the menu they are interested in
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </details>
             </p>
             <p>
                In addition, which doesn't align with 
                user's <b>conceptual models</b> (i.e., common expectations) for cafe websites, 
                where special menus or special items are typically highlighted.
             </p>
             <p>
                These issues can negatively impact user experience by making 
                it more difficult for users, especially these with disabilities, to access comprehensive information
                about the drinks on different menus and remember where to find them next time they visit the page.  As a result, 
                it may deter potential customers from then ordering items from the cafe or visiting it in-person.

        <div class="section-2">
            <h2>How can we redesign the page?</h2>
            <p>
                Let's start by designing a visual style guide for the 
                webpage (see scrollable image below). Inspired by the original website's 
                colors and typography, our style guide assigns distinct color codes 
                to different menus and applies different typography styles to menu 
                sections to create a clear informational hierarchy (e.g. menu title is semi-bolded, item description is light italic).
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary colors preserve the earthy, calm tone of the original page, 
                while the fresh secondary colors used on buttons help serve as visual indicators for the different menus.
            </p>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="style.png" alt="Visual style guide of the redesigned webpage">
            </div>
            <p>
                Next, we can create Figma mockups (prototypes) for the redesign. To accommodate 
                different screen sizes, we need to design responsive mockups for 
                desktop (width > 1200px), tablet (600-1200px width), and mobile (width < 600px) users. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As shown in the scrollable desktop mockup below, we added an overall explanation of the menu sections 
                as well as three color-coded buttons that direct users to their desired menu. Also, the menu sections 
                are now built as tables with aria labels for screenreaders, rather than static images, so users with 
                accessibility needs can access the same information as other users.
            </p>
            <p>
               While the original page includes a long description about the Ceremony tea house, it is removed in the redesigned 
               version since this information is already included on other pages of the website.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">Desktop version of the prototype</p>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="desktop.png" alt="Prototype of the redesigned webpage (desktop version)">
            </div>
            <p>
                In the scrollable tablet and mobile versions below, the number of items per row decreases to 
                reduce information overload but still preserves information completeness. However, styles such as 
                flex box, spacing, and font size remain the same, except for the spacing between buttons and 
                the font size of the nav bar items.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">Tablet version of the prototype</p>
            <div class="sketch-2">
                <img src="tablet.png" alt="Prototype of the redesigned webpage (tablet version)">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="italic">Mobile version of the prototype</p>
            <div class="sketch-3">
                <img src="mobile.png" alt="Prototype of the redesigned webpage (mobile version)">
            </div>
            <p>
                In the mobile version above, the navigation bar turns into an expandable hamburger 
                menu, and the buttons stack on top of each other vertically to maintain a clean and concise layout. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After deploying our <a href="https://cs1300-hw4-redesigned-website.vercel.app/">redesigned webpage</a>, 
                we ran it through the WAVE tool, which detected no regular or contrast errors (see screenshot below) 
                and confirmed the inclusion of aria labels. This tells us that our updated 
                website is more accessible than before!
            </p>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="wave_evaluation.png" alt="WAVE evaluation results of redesigned webpage">
            </div>
            <p>
                Note that the nav bar links in the redesigned page still redirect users to the old 
                Ceremony pages. Since we can't access the original social media icons used in the footer, they have been changed to plain images.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, our redesign addresses the usability and accessibility issues identified in the following ways:
                <div class="bubble-1">
                <ul>
                    <li>Better learnability through clear menu explanations and a logical information hierarchy</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Better memorability by using color-coded menu buttons to help users recall and navigate between different menus easily</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Better efficiency by quickly directing users to the menu section they are interested in through the click of menu buttons</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Better accessibility by making each menu take up bulk of the page space and by adding arial labels for all the drinks in each menu subsection table</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What have we learned from this exercise?</h2>
            <p>
                To summarize, in this webpage, we learned about how to 
                redesign a website to improve its usability and accessibility. 
                This is important for ensuring the website not only conveys 
                relevant information, but does so in a way that is friendly 
                and intuitive to users with different levels of experience 
                and accessibility needs. In the future, perhaps you can apply 
                the same structure to analyze and redesign other websites ü§î
