                    Have you wondered how usable applications are designed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this webpage, we will explore the method of <b>iterative design</b>, a continuous and
                    collaborative
                    process of identifying user problems, prototyping, gathering feedback, and refining the design to
                    meet real user needs. We will be using a real-world startup (Sesame), as a case study 🙂

                <h2>Step 1. Understanding the Problem Statement</h2>
                <p><a href="https://sesamecare.com/">Sesame</a> is a patient-centered healthcare
                    startup focused on connecting patients to affordable care. A key part of its
                    digital platform is a web-based medical content (blogs and videos) hub where patients can access
                    high-quality health information. The target users are <b>cost-conscious
                        patients</b> seeking credible provider options and <b>providers</b> looking to attract visits
                    through the platform.
                    Currently, Sesame aims to address three main design issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For patients: increase the readability and accessibility of medical content</li>
                    <li>For providers: improve the content creation experience through AI assistance and account growth
                        tracking</li>
                    <li>For both: create effective channels that convert patients into provider visits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ultimate goal is to deliver clear and trustworthy health information that guides patients
                    to care options, while boosting provider engagement and visibility. It is hence important
                    that our design satisfies the needs of both groups.

            <div class="section-2">
                <h2>Step 2. Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
                <p>Now that we understand the problems, we can brainstorm ideas and
                    create sketches. Below are four sets of sketches covering five key pages
                    we believe are essential to solving these issues in the content hub:
                    a blog homepage, an article page, a provider dashboard, and AI-assisted blog and video
                    creation pages. The sketches include a range of designs, such as different
                    AI interaction modes and CTAs (call-to-action elements) on the blog and dashboard pages.
                </p>
                <h3>Set 1</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_1.png" alt="Sketch Set 1">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 2</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_2.png" alt="Sketch Set 2">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 3</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_3.png" alt="Sketch Set 3">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 4</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_4.png" alt="Sketch Set 4">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next, we can combine these sketches to create <b>wireframes</b> using the Balsamiq software. We
                    created
                    a initial set of 4 wireframes. Under each one, you can read explanations about how it addresses a
                    problem
                    stated previously and impacts user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Page 1: Blog Homepage</h3>

                <div class="lofi-prototype">
                    <img src="lofi1_blog_home.png" alt="lofi1_blog_home">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Although our original sketches didn't include a blog homepage, during team discussions we
                        realized that adding one would help users discover topic-based content and browse articles based
                        on popularity. This enhancement supports increased user engagement and boosts <b>conversion
                            rates</b>.</li>
                    <li>Our design moves away from the original text-heavy blog and creates a <b>modular, user-focused
                            experience</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the top, the hero section now features a welcome message alongside a search bar, helping
                        users quickly find relevant health content. This upgrade improves information accessibility and
                        shifts the experience from passive reading to active exploration and interaction.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Page 2: Individual Article Page</h3>
                <div class="lofi-prototype">
                    <img src="lofi2_blog_subpage.png" alt="lofi2_blog_subpage">
                </div>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        We used the design from Set 1 as the baseline, as its layout is the most intuitive and offers a
                        strong <b>information hierarchy</b>.

                    </li>
                    <li>We also incorporated a floating section featuring the provider from Set 2. Users can click into
                        the provider's profile, book an appointment, or ask questions directly. By improving the
                        provider's <b>visibility</b>, we aim to increase conversion rates and help build the provider's
                        personal brand, which is aligned with Sesame's goal.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition, we added the video section from Set 4 to address the issue of long text and improve
                        article <b>readability</b>—especially for users who prefer video content. While this feature may
                        require more effort from providers, our built-in AI tool can streamline the process by
                        converting articles into video scripts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Page 3: Provider Dashboard</h3>
                <div class="lofi-prototype">
                    <img src="lofi3_provider_dashboard.png" alt="lofi3_provider_dashboard">
                </div>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        We combined the designs from Sets 1, 3, and 4. Specifically, we used Set 4 as the baseline and
                        integrated key features from Sets 1 and 3.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most important feature is the Quick Stats section, which provides providers with an
                        <b>immediate overview</b> of their content's performance—separated by articles and videos. By
                        displaying metrics such as total reads, conversion rates, and likes, we reinforce the tangible
                        value of their contributions. This aligns with Sesame's goal of encouraging providers to
                        consistently generate content by making performance data easily accessible and actionable.

                    </li>
                    <li>At the top right, the "Create Content" call-to-action is designed to encourage <b>immediate
                            content creation</b>. Clicking this button leads to an AI-powered editor, reducing the time
                        needed to publish high-quality content. This feature supports Sesame's mission to empower
                        providers to produce scalable and authentic content efficiently.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        Our team debated between two approaches. The first was a <b>step-by-step, modularized AI
                            assistant</b>. This approach makes it easy for providers to draft an article, as the steps
                        are built-in and clearly defined. However, it also greatly limits what a provider can do. The
                        second approach was a <b>chat-based AI assistant</b>. This offers providers more freedom but is
                        more open-ended, and users might not engage with it as we intend.

                    </li>
                    <li>After analyzing the trade-offs, we decided to go with the chat-based AI assistant, considering
                        users' conceptual models regarding AI assistants—they may already be familiar with this format
                        through prior experience with tools like ChatGPT and Claude.</li>
                    <li>We also created an <b>interactive canvas</b> for user editing (inspired by set 2), where users
                        can highlight sentences they want to refine and prompt the AI to revise them.
                    </li>
                    <li>After some discussion, we decided not to include a blog generation feature in order to preserve
                        providers' <b>autonomy</b> in content creation and to prevent potential misinformation or errors
                        in AI-generated content.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <div class="section-1">
                <h2>Step 3. First Round of Feedback from Startup</h2>
                <p>
                  After presenting our low-fidelity wireframes to Sesame’s product team, we received thoughtful and encouraging feedback from Ravi Mehta and Chris Chon. Below is a summary of the major themes from the feedback:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Modular Hero Section:</b> The team appreciated the simplicity and modularity of the homepage layout. Chris expressed interest in seeing stronger visual treatments in the HiFi version.</li>
                  <li><b>Search Experience:</b> Ravi noted that users are often overwhelmed by traditional search and struggle with medical terminology. Both Ravi and Chris encouraged us to design a more <b>assistive and exploratory</b> search feature to guide passive users toward active discovery.</li>
                  <li><b>Visual Design Consistency:</b> Feedback included ensuring consistency in thumbnails and style for articles, especially as content scales. Ravi asked for design guidelines for choosing images.</li>
                  <li><b>Content Organization:</b> Ravi suggested refining the taxonomy of topics and determining which categories are best to feature. Chris asked how headers like "Featured" and "Not sure where to start" were chosen and encouraged research-based justification.</li>
                  <li><b>Fact-Checking and CTA Design:</b> Chris encouraged us to prototype what fact-checking and interactive CTAs (like "ask me questions") would look like in HiFi.</li>
                  <li><b>Dashboard and Stats:</b> Chris and Ravi were excited about the AI insight section and asked whether other metrics might better incentivize providers to create content. Suggestions were made for personalization and recommendation features for logged-in users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This feedback helped us prioritize clarity, interactivity, and scalable design systems in our HiFi iterations.

                <p>
                    After delivering our high-fidelity prototype, we conducted another review session with the Sesame
                    team. They appreciated the clearer conversion pathways and praised the AI assistant’s modularity and
                    editing experience. Our changes addressed the key feedback points raised in Step 3 and aligned
                    closely with Sesame’s strategic vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would run usability tests on mobile responsiveness, A/B test the blog layout
                    vs. provider-first layout, and gather analytics on engagement with Drafty AI.
                    Overall, this project taught us the value of iterative user feedback and how collaborative design
                    can support both patient and provider needs in real-world applications.
