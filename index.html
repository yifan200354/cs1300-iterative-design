                Have you wondered how usable applications are designed? 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this webpage, we will explore the method of <b>iterative design</b>, a continuous and collaborative 
                process of identifying user problems, prototyping, gathering feedback, and refining the design to 
                meet real user needs. We will be using a real-world startup (Sesame), as a case study ðŸ™‚

            <h2>Step 1. Understanding the Problem Statement</h2>
            <p><a href="https://sesamecare.com/">Sesame</a> is a patient-centered healthcare 
                startup focused on connecting patients to affordable care. A key part of its 
                digital platform is a web-based medical content (blogs and videos) hub where patients can access 
                high-quality health information. The target users are <b>cost-conscious 
                patients</b> seeking credible provider options and <b>providers</b> looking to attract visits through the platform. 
                Currently, Sesame aims to address three main design issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For patients: increase the readability and accessibility of medical content</li>
                <li>For providers: improve the content creation experience through AI assistance and account growth tracking</li>
                <li>For both: create effective channels that convert patients into provider visits</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ultimate goal is to deliver clear and trustworthy health information that guides patients 
                to care options, while boosting provider engagement and visibility. It is hence important 
                that our design satisfies the needs of both groups.

            <h2>Step 2. Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
            <p>Now that we understand the problems, we can brainstorm ideas and 
                create sketches. Below are four sets of sketches covering five key pages 
                we believe are essential to solving these issues in the content hub: 
                a blog homepage, an article page, a provider dashboard, and AI-assisted blog and video 
                creation pages. The sketches include a range of designs, such as different 
                AI interaction modes and CTAs (call-to-action elements) on the blog and dashboard pages.
            </p>
            <h3>Set 1</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_1.png" alt="Sketch Set 1">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 2</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_2.png" alt="Sketch Set 2">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 3</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_3.png" alt="Sketch Set 3">
            </div>
            <h3>Set 4</h3>
            <div class="sketch">
                <img src="sketch_4.png" alt="Sketch Set 4">
            </div>
            <p>
                Next, we can combine these sketches to create <b>wireframes</b> using the Balsamiq software. We created 
                a initial set of 4 wireframes. Under each one, you can read explanations about how it addresses a problem 
                stated previously and impacts user experience.
