                    Have you wondered how usable applications are designed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this webpage, we will explore the method of <b>iterative design</b>, a continuous and
                    collaborative
                    process of identifying user problems, prototyping, gathering feedback, and refining the design to
                    meet real user needs. We will be using a real-world startup (Sesame), as a case study 🙂

                <h2>Step 1. Understanding the Problem Statement</h2>
                <p><a href="https://sesamecare.com/">Sesame</a> is a patient-centered healthcare
                    startup focused on connecting patients to affordable care. A key part of its
                    digital platform is a web-based medical content (blogs and videos) hub where patients can access
                    high-quality health information. The target users are <b>cost-conscious
                    patients</b> seeking credible provider options and <b>providers</b> looking to attract visits
                    through the platform.
                    Currently, Sesame aims to address three main design issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For patients: increase the readability and accessibility of medical content</li>
                    <li>For providers: improve the content creation experience through AI assistance and account growth
                        tracking</li>
                    <li>For both: create effective channels that convert patients into provider visits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ultimate goal is to deliver clear and trustworthy health information that guides patients
                    to care options, while boosting provider engagement and visibility. It is hence important
                    that our design satisfies the needs of both groups.

                <h2>Step 2. Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
                <p>Now that we understand the problems, we can brainstorm ideas and
                    create sketches. Below are 4 sets of sketches covering 4 key pages
                    we believe are essential to solving these issues in the content hub:
                    a blog article page, a provider dashboard, and AI-assisted blog and video
                    creation pages. The sketches include a range of designs, such as different
                    AI interaction modes and CTAs (call-to-action elements) on the blog and dashboard pages.
                </p>
                <h3>Set 1</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_1.png" alt="Sketch Set 1">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 2</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_2.png" alt="Sketch Set 2">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 3</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_3.png" alt="Sketch Set 3">
                </div>
                <h3>Set 4</h3>
                <div class="sketch">
                    <img src="sketch_4.png" alt="Sketch Set 4">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next, we can combine these sketches to create <b>wireframes</b> using the Balsamiq software. We
                    created
                    a initial set of 4 wireframes. Under each one, you can read explanations about how it addresses a
                    problem
                    stated previously and impacts user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Page 1: Blog Homepage</h3>

                <div class="lofi-prototype">
                    <img src="lofi1_blog_home.png" alt="lofi1_blog_home">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        Although our original sketches didn't include a blog homepage, we realized 
                        during team discussions that adding one would help users explore topic-based 
                        content and browse by popularity, hence boosting user engagement and improving conversion rates.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We moved away from a text-heavy layout and designed a <b>modular, user-focused 
                        experience</b> that feels more dynamic and personalized.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The hero section now features a welcome message and search bar, helping 
                        users find relevant health content quickly. This improves accessibility and encourages 
                        <b>active exploration</b> over passive reading.
                      </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Page 2: Individual Article Page</h3>

                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>
                        We used the design from Set 1 as the baseline, since its layout is the most intuitive 
                        and offers a clear <b>information hierarchy</b>.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We integrated a floating provider section from Set 2. Users can click into the provider's 
                        profile, book an appointment, or ask questions. By increasing <b>provider visibility</b>, we 
                        aim to boost conversions and support personal brand-building, which aligns with Sesame's goals.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        To improve article <b>readability</b>, especially for users who prefer visual content, we added the
                        video section from Set 4. 
                      </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Page 3: Provider Dashboard</h3>

                  <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>We combined the strongest elements from Sets 1, 3, and 4, using Set 4 as the foundation and layering in key features from the others.</li>
                    <li>The most important addition is the <b>Quick Stats</b> section, which gives providers a snapshot of their content's performance, broken down by articles and videos.</li>
                    <li>This visibility aligns with Sesame's goal of encouraging consistent content creation by making performance data <b>easily accessible and actionable</b>.</li>
                    <li>We also placed a "Create Content" call-to-action at the top right to prompt immediate engagement.</li>
                    <li>Clicking the button leads to an AI assistant, helping providers publish high-quality content more efficiently.</li>
                  </ul>

                <p class="explanation">
                    Our team debated two different approaches for the AI assistant. Below is a breakdown of the options we considered and the reasoning behind our final decision:
                </p>
                  <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>We explored a <b>step-by-step, modularized AI assistant</b> that simplifies article drafting by guiding providers through clear steps. However, this approach limited flexibility and creativity.</li>
                    <li>We also considered a chat-based AI assistant, which gives providers more freedom but is more open-ended and might not always lead to the intended outcomes.</li>
                    <li>We chose the chat-based model because users are already familiar with this format through tools like ChatGPT and Claude, which aligns with their mental models of how AI works.</li>
                    <li>We also introduced an <b>interactive canvas for editing</b>, where users can highlight specific sentences and prompt the AI to revise them, drawing inspiration from our second concept set.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h2>Step 3. First Round of Feedback from Startup</h2>
                <p class="explanation">
                  After sharing our low-fidelity wireframes with Sesame's product team (advisor Ravi Mehta and design lead Chris Chon), we received thoughtful and actionable feedback. Below is a summary of the key themes:
                </p>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>Home page: The team liked the simplicity and modular layout of the homepage. </li>
                    <li>Home page: Ravi suggested refining topic categories. Chris questioned headers like "Featured" and "Not sure where to start," and pushed us to back these choices with user research.</li>
                    <li>Article page: They emphasized the need for consistent styling across articles, as well as the possibility of including related content and utilize the knowledge of authenticated users in the insights section. </li>
                    <li>AI assistant page: Ravi pointed out the need to balance between modular approach while also ensuring usability of the page.</li>
                    <li>AI assistant page: Chris encouraged further prototyping interactive elements like fact-checking.</li>
                    <li>Provider dashboard: Both were excited about the AI insights section; Chris suggested including more meaningful stats to better motivate providers, while Ravi emphasized offering clearer guidance on what topics providers should write about.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              

            <div class="section-2">
                <h2>Step 4. Hi-Fi Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    Below are the final high-fidelity prototypes for five redesigned screens. Each layout emphasizes
                    usability, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy while addressing Sesame's problem statements. 
                </p>

                <h3>Page 1: Blog Homepage</h3>
                <div class="lofi-prototype">
                    <img src="Blog homepage.png" alt="Hi-Fi Blog Homepage">
                </div>
                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>Integrated a bold hero section with guided search prompts, directly addressing feedback about shifting users from passive reading to active exploration.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced search functionality with natural language support, reflecting concerns about users struggling with medical jargon or not knowing what to search for.</li>
                    <li>Redesigned the article layout to emphasize high-impact content, implementing feedback on improving visual hierarchy and user flow through the homepage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Page 2: Individual Article Page</h3>

                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>The hi-fi design addressed the first feedback by moving the video to the hero section. For articles without a video, a hero image
                        can be placed instead, making the overall layout more consistent.
                    <li>The hi-fi design incorporated the second piece of feedback by adding an “Explore More” section 
                        at the end of each article, recommending similar content to encourage continued engagement.</li>
                    <li>The hi-fi design responded to the third feedback by tailoring the AI-generated key insights based on user data—for example, their demographics or health concerns.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Displays article count, reads, bookings, and conversion rate with rank context (e.g., “Top 1% performer”), reflecting feedback to incentivize providers through status and performance comparison.</li>
                    <li>Highlights trending topics and suggested content creation areas based on user interest and platform trends, addressing feedback about helping providers choose impactful topics.</li>
                    <li>Clear CTAs for “Create Articles,” “Use Drafty AI,” and “View Performance” encourage frequent publishing and experimentation, aligning with feedback to turn insights into actions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Page 4: AI Assistant Page</h3>

                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>We incorporated the startup's feedback to ensure the AI assistant and chat input prompts clearly state the type of content expected from users at each stage of the workflow.</li>
                    <li>We also further refined features such as the two interactive canvases as the team members requested.</li>
                </ul>     

                <h3>Page 5: Appointment Booking Flow</h3>

                <ul class="explanation">
                    <li>This is a new page we added where patients can book directly from within article or provider views, streamlining their journey from discovery to conversion.</li>
                    <li>Patients can browse available times across providers without toggling between multiple pages.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-1">

                    After delivering our <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/fj3E49BbCGWkeIIAf4YqGV/Hi-fi-Prototype-4-10?node-id=0-1&t=P6vnD2MB2xYYA67d-1">high-fidelity prototype</a>, we conducted another review session with the Sesame
                    team. They appreciated the clearer conversion pathways and praised the AI assistant's modularity and
                    editing experience. 
                </p>
                <p class="explanation">
                    If we had more time, we would run usability tests on mobile responsiveness, A/B test the blog layout
                    vs. provider-first layout, and gather analytics on engagement with Drafty AI. 
                    Overall, this project taught us the value of iterative user feedback and how collaborative design
                    can support both patient and provider needs in real-world applications.
